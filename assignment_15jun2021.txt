1. Write a simple program for nested comments. what is the error & how we resolve it?

/*
write some code for requirment 1
/*
write some code for requirment 2
*/
write some code for requirment 3
*/
Once block comment is opened compiler will search for nearest closing block comment. 
Therefore in nested comments some of the content will be un commented which will show error.
To resolve we can go for line by line comment or we should not use nested comments.

2. A block of code is given to you and comment out all the code.
ans- shift+/
     //
     block comment if there is no any nented comment scenario.

3. execute the following code and note down the outputs

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
char ch1, ch2, ch3;
ch1 = 65; ch2 = 'b';
ch3 = '3';
printf(" ch1 =%c\n", ch1); I
printf(" ch2 = %c\n", ch2);
printf(“ ch3 = %c\n”, ch3);
printf(" ch1 = %d\n", ch1); 
printf(" ch2 = %d\n", ch2);
printf(" ch3 = %d\n", ch3);
}
Ans: 
ch1 =A
ch2 =b
ch3 =3
ch1 =65
ch2 =98
ch3 =51
